            <em> Have you heard about it? </em> <br>
            If the answer is yes, go away from here this is'nt the blog for you,
            but if the answer is yes continue reading. <br>
            The term retrograde comes from the Latin word retrogradus, which literally means “backward step.”
    
            As the name suggests, retrograde is when a planet appears to go backward in its orbit, as viewed from Earth. <br>
            Astronomers refer to this as “apparent retrograde motion,” because it is an optical illusion.
    
            The <a href="https://www.farmersalmanac.com/mercury-retrograde#:~:text=The%20opposite%20of%20retrograde%20is,the%20term%20%E2%80%9Cdirect%E2%80%9D%20motion."> 
            opposite of retrograde </a> is direct or prograde motion. Prograde motion is the term astronomers prefer, while
            astrologers are more prone to use the term “direct” motion.

            Mercury rules communication, travel, news, information, gossip and technology. This means that we can expect
            meltdowns,
            false gossip, miscommunications, technology fails (which is why it’s best to back up files and contacts before the
            retrograde), issues in travel, missed connections and delays in hearing pertinent information.
            <p class="important"> If you’re expecting a raise or promotion, it could take longer to get the paperwork in
            motion. If you’re planning a vacation, you may experience issues while away. Your smartphone could break, you
            could be accidentally billed twice by the cable company or an old friend or ex could even resurface in 
            some capacity. An argument could also create tension in a relationship that will be all consuming during this transit.

        When Mercury enters retrograde motion within the range of dates for a given astrological sign, be wary of the listed
        effects.
        Note that the planet Mercury rules both Gemini and Virgo so these two signs are most heavily affected.
