        The term retrograde comes from the Latin word retrogradus, which literally means “backward step.”

        As the name suggests, retrograde is when a planet appears to go backward in its orbit, as viewed from Earth. <br>
        Astronomers refer to this as “apparent retrograde motion,” because it is an optical illusion.

        The opposite of retrograde is direct or prograde motion. Prograde motion is the term astronomers prefer, while
        astrologers are more prone to use the term “direct” motion.

        Mercury rules communication, travel, news, information, gossip and technology. This means that we can expect
        meltdowns,
        false gossip, miscommunications, technology fails (which is why it’s best to back up files and contacts before the
        retrograde), issues in travel, missed connections and delays in hearing pertinent information.
        <p class="important"> If you’re expecting a raise or promotion, it could take longer to get the paperwork in
        motion. If you’re planning a vacation, you may experience issues while away. Your smartphone could break, you could be
        accidentally billed twice by the cable company or an old friend or ex could even resurface in some capacity. An
        argument could also create tension in a relationship that will be all consuming during this transit.
